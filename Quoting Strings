//When definfin a string u must start and end with a single or double quote ('' or " ").
//In JS u can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote, like this:

const something = "Ian said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";


//Quoting String with quotes:

const conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"';

We used both types of quotes in the sentence above, teh result would be: Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!".
