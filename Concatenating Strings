//Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

let ourStr = "I come first";
ourStr += "I come second."

ourStr now has a value of "I come first. I come second."


//Constructing Strings with Variables:

const myName = "Ian";
const fullName = "My full name is " + myName + " Quintana.";

const fullName would have a value of "My full name is Ian Quintana."


//Appending Variables to Strings.
//We can also append variables to a String using the plus equals (+=) operator:

const anAdjective = "Delicious!";
let ourStr = "The pie was ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

ourStr would have a value of "The pie was Delicious!";
