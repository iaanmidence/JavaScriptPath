//Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable.
This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

const dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",
  Hunter: "Doberman",
  Snoopie: "Beagle"
};

const myDog = "Hunter";
const myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed);

The string Doberman would be displayed in the console.

const cats = {
  Suyapa: "mother",
  Perico: "son",
  Ian: "owner"
}

const myCat = "Perico";
const myFirst = cats[myCat];
console.log(myFirst);

The string Perico would be displayed in the console.
