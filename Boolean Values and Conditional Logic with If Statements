//booleans may only be one of two values: True of False. They're basically little on-off switches, where true is on and False is off.

//"if" statements are used to make decision in code. "if" tells JS to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions,
defined in the parentheses. Theses conditions are know as "boolean" conditions and they may only be true or false.
When the condition is true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. when the boolean condition evaluates to false,
the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode:

if (
condition is true
statement is executed


Example:

function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
      return "it was True";
      }
      return "it was false";
      }
test(true);
test(false);


//"testTrue" returns the string "it was true", and "testFalse" returns the string "it was false".
When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function
returns "it was true". When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and will return "it was false".
